# Conclusions

This case study demonstrates how internal reconnaissance contributes to SOC operations by improving asset visibility, validating service exposure, and supporting informed risk assessment.

The investigation successfully identified exposed services, validated OS characteristics despite ambiguity, and confirmed port behavior using multiple scanning techniques. By correlating results across scans, false positives were reduced and confidence in findings was increased.

While the identified services were appropriate for the system’s role, their presence highlights the need for strong access controls, monitoring, and alerting to prevent misuse in the event of credential compromise or lateral movement attempts.

Overall, this assessment reflects realistic SOC workflows involving reconnaissance, validation, and risk-based decision making, reinforcing the importance of methodical analysis over tool-driven assumptions.
